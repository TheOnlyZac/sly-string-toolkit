1179,"Breaker Alpha Foxtrot, this be the Wizard, ye hear me, Sitting Duck?"
1180,"Aye, this be Peking Duck, I hear ye, Blizzard."
1181,"Nay Sly, I be “the Wizard” and ye be “Sitting Duck.”"
1182,"I be hearin' ye loud and clear, Lizard."
1183,"Nay I be… forget it, ye be not takin' this seriously."
1184,"Aye, I be not. Look Bentley, I be knowin' this be yer first voyage out in the seas, but ye got to loosen up. If we be wantin' to reach those Clockwerk Parts, I need ye sharp as a cutlass. So, in plain talk, what be yer status?"
1185,"Well, I be makin' port in the basement and I be sure I can rewire the service elevator if ye can power it up from that security station."
1186,"Hang tough matey, it might take some time, but I'll be figurin' a way to reach the top."
1190,"Aye, I spliced the wires… Ouch! Wait a moment… there it be!"
1191,"Aye, aye, let me at that security computer."
1192,The laser security system be off-line… I be workin' on the security gate.
1193,The spotlights be off-line…
1194,"Presto, all clear."
1195,"Thanks matey, for yer first voyage ye did pretty well."
1196,"This operation be far from complete. Now that the lasers and spotlights be off-line, Murray should be makin' his way to ye for the rendezvous. I'll be stayin' here and providin' computer support while ye go ahead."
1197,"Um… attention all guards, this be the network administrator. We be installin' some new software in the security mainframe… so don’t be alarmin' if some systems be turnin' off for a bit. Uhh, thank ye… ye be all doin' a grand job."
1198,"According to me information, the Clockwerk parts be stored up there… Now to reach 'em, ye got to meet up with Murray at the rendezvous point… unfortunately, the path through the garden be heavily guarded."
1199,"No problem, I'll be takin' the long way around."
1200,"If me memory serves, ye need to jump and hit &2O&. to run along ropes."
1201,Murray must have gotten lost along the way. Try pressin' ahead without him.
1202,Thunder Flop!
1203,Greetings citizen. I hope ye weren't harmed by me meteoropic entrance.
1204,"Nay Murray, I kept at a safe distance."
1205,"Good, good… the Thunder Flop knows neither friend nor foe, only destruction."
1206,"Aye, could ye channel some of that “raw energy” into this security gate?"
1207,"Of course, it be nothin' before “The Murray.”"
1208,Unghh… OK… all… clear.
1209,"Another barrier stands before ye… fear not, I shall bend it like the truth."
1210,"Solid work Murray, ye be in the zone."
1211,"Me behemoth build be too much fer that scrawny cordage. Ye go ahead and release the hatches from within, I'll be waitin' in the passageway to lend a hand with carryin' out the Clockwerk Pieces."
1212,I don't comprehend ye Sly... the Clockwerk pieces should be here... this be all wrong; we need to scuttle this operation at once!
1213,"Hold fast, Cooper!"
1214,Inspector Fox... as lovely and unpredictable as ever.
1215,"Whereas ye scallywags be sooo predictable, ye always return to the scene of the plunder."
1216,Plunder? I haven't swiped anythin'... yet.
1217,Oh really? Then who broke in last night and made off with all the Clockwerk pieces? Ye've got the drive.
1218,Someone already pilfered the pieces!?
1219,Don't play the fool with me.
1220,It might not have been him Carmelita. The method of entry and guard losses all point to this bein' a Klaww Gang job.
1221,The Klaww Gang?
1222,"Constable Neyla, I allowed ye to sit in on this ambush as a favor to the Contessa... I truly don't need any assistance."
1223,Oh I think ye might. Take a gander at the facts.
1224,Facts!? Sly Cooper be right here! I caught him red handed.
1225,I'm just sayin' that there be other villains in the world other than-
1226,Sly Cooper! After him!
1227,"Halt, rogue!"
1228,Stay put!
1229,Ye can't flee forever!
1230,Halt!
1231,"Hey, come back here, ringtail!"
1233,Oh heavens! Wait fer me Sly!
1234,"Hie thee Murray, it's time to set sail."
1235,This wasn't part of the plan.
1236,Aye well... this be where things get lively.
1237,"This be gettin' a bit heated. Ye scallywags go warm up the vessel, I'll keep Carmelita occupied."
1238,Ye'll all be headed to Davy Jones' Locker!
1239,Pluck me up at the meetin' place.
1240,I'm steerin' towards ye position... leap in quickly so we can make our escape!
1241,I'll track ye down Cooper.
